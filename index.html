                <li>Lorem</li>
                <p>The resulting website consists of a set of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, and other assets, that can be served by a web server to visitors.

        <section class="why" id="why">
            
            <h3>Simplicity</h3>
            <p>Unlike dynamic websites that generate content on the server side, SSGs pre-build the entire site during the development process. This results in faster loading times and simplified hosting. With an SSG, developers can create and organize content using familiar tools like Markdown, while the generator takes care of converting it into static HTML files. The simplicity lies in the ease of updating and maintaining websites, reduced server complexity, and improved performance.</p>
          
            <h3>Performance</h3>
            <p>SSGs contribute to enhanced website performance through pre-building the entire site during development. This pre-rendering process generates static HTML files, allowing for quicker loading times and improved user experiences. Since the content is delivered directly to the user without server-side processing, SSGs reduce server load and minimize the need for database queries during runtime.</p>
           
            <h3>Security</h3>
            <p>Since SSGs generate static HTML files during the development phase, there is no server-side processing or dynamic content rendering, which inherently mitigates certain types of security risks associated with server vulnerabilities. Additionally, SSGs often integrate well with Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), distributing content closer to users and providing an extra layer of security through caching and DDoS protection. The reduced reliance on server-side operations and databases minimizes potential attack vectors, making static site generators a security-conscious choice for web development.</p>

        <h2 class="pros-cons-title">Pros and Cons</h2>
        <section class="pros-cons" id="pros-cons">
            <ul>
                <h3>Pros</h3>
                <li>Simplicity</li>
                <p>The reason why static site generators are so easy to use is because there is minimal setup when setting up the server. Once it is installed, you can start creating content without needing to worry about the database. Using SSG is also good when seperating files
                    as they use plain text files for content and templates define the layout and styling of the webpage. 
                </p>
                <li>Performance</li>
                <p>Since Static Site Generators are pre-built, they are much faster to load than dynamic websites becuase it is already loaded and read to use. This helps with user experience and can help with devices that do not connect as fast </p>
                <li>Security</li>
                <p>Since static site websites are not reliant of databases or server sided processing, this leadds to less attcks on the server which makes using a staic site genertaor more efficant.</p>
                <li>Cost-effective</li>
                <p>Since SSG does not use server sided processing or database to manage, theres less risk on the server becuase maintenance is less needed so then IT support/ tech support is not not needed.</p>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <h3>Cons</h3>
                <li>Lack of interactivity</li>
                <p>Unlike dynamic websites, static sites cannot handle user input or generate content becuase the content is already pre-decided </p>
                <li>No user-friendly interface </li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Fixed content</li>
                <p>Since the content is already pre-generated, making any changes towards the website need to be changed and then re-uploaded to the server.</p>
                <li>Lack of personality</li>
                <p>As said before the SSG is pre-built so you cannot edit it or add anything to it that adds your personality to the website.</p>
                <li>Limited framework options</li>
                <p>You you choose to use SSG's there are only so many tenplates to choose from before you run out of options.</p>
            </ul>
