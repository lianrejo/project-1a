    <h2>Why Would You Use It?</h2>
    <h3>Simplicity</h3>
    <p>The flexibility in web development hinges on the choice between Content Management Systems (CMS) and static sites. CMS platforms, linked to databases with specific fields, may require additional tools like plugins or custom functionalities to add widgets. In contrast, static sites enable a more direct integration of widgets into files, simplifying the development process.Static sites can be as limited or as flexible compared to CMS. For example, if using Markdown or similar flat files, editors are less able to make mistakes or adversely affect page styling.</p>
    <h3>Performance</h3>
    <p>Static sites can create pre-cached pages that dont expire. Files can also me reduced to size to better load out on the page via global content delivery networks (CDNs). Serving a status site is also less intensive- server just has to return flat files so scaling according to traffic demand becomes simple.</p>
    <h3>Security</h3>
    <p>Some risks remain in static sites but theyre rarely problematic. For example, someone can gain access to a server via SSH or FTP and deface pages or upload files but its simple to check for changes, wipe site and regenerate again. </p>
