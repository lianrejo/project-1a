    <h2>Why Would You Use It?</h2>
    <h3>Simplicity</h3>
    <p>The flexibility in web development hinges on the choice between Content Management Systems (CMS) and static sites. CMS platforms, linked to databases with specific fields, may require additional tools like plugins or custom functionalities to add widgets. In contrast, static sites enable a more direct integration of widgets into files, simplifying the development process.Static sites can be as limited or as flexible compared to CMS. For example, if using Markdown or similar flat files, editors are less able to make mistakes or adversely affect page styling.</p>
    <h3>Performance</h3>
    <p>Static sites can create pre-cached pages that dont expire. Files can also me reduced to size to better load out on the page via global content delivery networks (CDNs). Serving a status site is also less intensive- server just has to return flat files so scaling according to traffic demand becomes simple.</p>
    <h3>Security</h3>
    <p>Some risks remain in static sites but theyre rarely problematic. For example, someone can gain access to a server via SSH or FTP and deface pages or upload files but its simple to check for changes, wipe site and regenerate again. </p>

   <section id="where">
    <h2>Where would you use Static Site Generators</h2>
    <p>Projects like personal blogs, documentation sites, landing pages, company websites, portfolio pages and brochure webpages.</p>

   <ul>
   
    <h2>Pros and Cons </h2>

    <h3>Pros</h3>
    <li>Simplicity</li>
    <p>The reason why static site generators are so easy to use is because there is minimal setup when setting up the server. Once it is installed, you can start creating content without needing to worry about the database. Using SSG is also good when seperating files
        as they use plain text files for content and templates define the layout and styling of the webpage. 
    </p>
    <li>Performace</li>
    <p>Since Static Site Generators are pre-built, they are much faster to load than dynamic websites becuase it is already loaded and read to use. This helps with user experience and can help with devices that do not connect as fast </p>
    <li>Security</li>
    <p>Since static site websites are not reliant of databases or server sided processing, this leadds to less attcks on the server which makes using a staic site genertaor more efficant.</p>
    <li>Cost-effective</li>
    <p>Since SSG does not use server sided processing or database to manage, theres less risk on the server becuase maintenance is less needed so then IT support/ tech support is not not needed.</p>
   </ul>
   <h3>Cons</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>Lack of interactivity</li>
    <p>Unlike dynamic websites, static sites cannot handle user input or generate content becuase the content is already pre-decided </p>
    <li>No user-friendly interface </li>
    <p></p>
    <li>Fixed content</li>
    <p>Since the content is already pre-generated, making any changes towards the website need to be changed and then re-uploaded to the server.</p>
    <li>Lack of personality</li>
    <p>As said before the SSG is pre-built so you cannot edit it or add anything to it that adds your personality to the website.</p>
    <li>Limited framework options</li>
    <p>You you choose to use SSG's there are only so many tenplates to choose from before you run out of options.</p>
    
   </ul>

   <section id="SSG-CMS">
    <h2>SSG VS CMS</h2>
    <p>The differance between static site generators and content managment systems are that 
        SSG generates the HTML pages during the building process. SSG are also fast, secure and do not need alot of maintenance to maintain the site.
        They are also the perfect webpages for blogs and documentation sites compared to CMS which are more ideal for dynamic sites that are updated more often. 
        You are also able to collaborte with other compared to SSG. While using CMSs it may be required maintanece and resource-intensive. But, by using this system it 
        is more user friendly and has more features.
